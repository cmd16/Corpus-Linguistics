	*goodnight hug*

	So apparently somebody is keeping a baby squirrel in his dorm lol

	Ikr lol

	He said he plans to release it though

	Lol yep

	Hmmmmmmmm

	Hi!

	There was a deal that if you dress up like a pirate or use the pirate filter on snapchat then you get a free dozen donuts at Krispy Kreme so I went with my friends but the line was too long so we just went to five and below to look at stuff for fun lol

	Yep lol

	Yeah lol

	Just get through the next two years and then you can go to college lol

	Yeah lol

	You can do it

	You can get through junior year (and senior year, but senior year is easier lol)

	Yep lol

	Hmmmmm

	Idk lol

	Yep lol

	Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

	Yep lol

	Hmmmmmm

	Hmmmmmmm

	Idk lol

	Yep lol

	*good morning hug*

	So what’s new lol

	Lol ok

	hey

	So there's this thing called dance guild (it's the biggest student organization and it has subgroups for all the different dances and they do a show in November). I thought it would be fun to do swing dancing because it seems cool and I know the guy who's teaching/choreographing it but I couldn't find a partner (#foreveralone) but they said you can come if you don't have a partner and they'll match you up with somebody so I came and there were several other girls without partners and I was like "ok I'll get paired with one of them it's cool" and then the leader was like "we have some extra girls so just find a couple to join and then the guy will go twice for auditions" (why does it have to be so heteronormative ugh) so I was third wheeling and as the couple I went to was learning the moves they spent most of the time together and by the time it got to my turn it had moved on to learning the next move or there wasn't enough time for me to learn the move so finally the leader noticed and the leader apologized and then I saw another couple and the guy taught me the moves and all that and so we auditioned together and it went okayish but it doesn't matter because even if I somehow didn't suck and did well enough to be one of ten couples (there were like 20 couples who auditioned I think but idk) who gets in I still don't have a partner and you can't swing dance alone and I don't have anybody.





	hey are you there

	Sorry service here sucks I just got this message now

	*hugs back*

	Grand Rapids Michigan

	What college?

	Cool! I'm not sure what school that is either but if you remember the name let me know

	Oh ok

	That’s like 2 and a half hours away from Calvin

	Yeah I’m at Calvin

	That would be nice 😊

	Smh why does the computer keep autocorrecting to emojis lol

	So what’s new lol

	Yep

	I don’t like it

	It feels so unnatural

	Apple probably thinks it’s more user friendly but it’s not

	Yeah lol

	I didn’t notice lol I always just use my thumbprint to unlock my phone

	I have to go now ttyl

	Ok I'm back

	Yeah

	You were talking about college

	Yeah

	So what other colleges are you considering?

	Oh ok cool

	VT has really good food

	I went on a visit and ate at the cafeteria

	Yeah lol

	Yeah

	Hmm





	Cool lol

	Yeah

	*goodnight hug*

	There was a group of guys serenading the dorm across from me and I heard them so I got out and joined them it was awesome

	That sucks

	*hugs you*

	I'm sorry that sucks

	Ok

	Sorry

	I just wish there was something I could do to make you feel better

	Ok if you say so

	Fun fact: in the game Dragon Age, if you get a companion's approval high enough then they get stat bonuses and you get opportunities for other quests, abilities, etc. and if you choose the right dialogue options you can initiate a romance. I boosted approval ratings to get the positive benefits and then accidentally chose the romance options so now I'm dating three people at once o.0 nobody's called me out on it yet lol

	What part are you confused about lol

	Have you ever played an rpg before

	Ok so you play as a character that you create. There are battles, quests, and all that fun stuff. You have a party (i.e. group of people) that you travel with. You can have conversations with them. In dragon age, certain conversations and plot actions make companions approve or disapprove of you, and their approval score affects the game. If a companion likes you enough, you can start a romance with them by choosing certain dialogue options. Does that make sense?

	In dragon age, you can start a romance with a character while you're still in a romance with another character (though eventually a jealousy/where is this going conversation will occur). The aforementioned conversation hasn't occurred yet so I'm currently dating 3 companions: a male rogue (assasin), a female rogue (bard), and a male warrior (Templar)

	Ugh I thought I was far enough past the smoke pit so I stopped holding my breath. That was a mistake. 

	I have to walk past it to get anywhere smh

	Because it's right next to my dorm

	Sorry I should have made that clear lol

	One of the characters finally called me out on it so I had to break up with one of the other characters. I'm now only dating one (or maybe two?) people

	It just took a while for the conversation to happen lol

	...I think I accidentally just started dating the character I dumped? So now I'm dating both of them again?

	Ikr lol

	Wait hang on I gotta show you this really funny conversation from earlier I'm gonna redo it and take a video on my phone

	File Transfer: IMG_7055.MOV.mov

	I love the way he says it the second time: "Have you ever licked a lamppost in winter?"

	That's Alastair, the guy who got jealous about me dating Zevran (another male character) so I broke up with Zevran except I accidentally started dating him again





	Ikr lol

	The most characters you could date at once before being caught would be three bc four of the characters are romanceable: a straight guy (Alistair), a bi guy (Zevran), a bi girl (Leilana), and a straight girl (Morrigan)

	File Transfer: 49643123963__79CA738F-341B-4D96-86A7-344FF2FF1E75.JPGLol I was in this random encounter and I'm like where's the action so I start walking and then this shows up



	File Transfer: 49643123963__79CA738F-341B-4D96-86A7-344FF2FF1E75.JPGLol I was in this random encounter and I'm like where's the action so I start walking and then this shows up



	It's a giant spider

	Lol

	K

	Omg nice 

	Cool

	I'm fine lol

	Yes lol

	Yep lol

	Lol now I'm just imagining two people referencing the dialogue I mentioned from dragon age. Person 1: Have you ever licked a lamppost in winter? Person 2: No, I haven't found the right lamppost yet. 

	Other responses: I did, but it didn't taste right; Not yet, do you wanna try it together, licked? No, that's too gentle, not my style; lampposts aren't really my thing, I'm more of a tree kind of person

	The possibilities are endless

	Make me





	Ok but if you really want me to stop then I will

	No, lampposts are too tall for my liking

	I considered it, but the lamp wasn't hot enough 

	No, lampposts aren't too bright so that's no good

	Yes, I have a lamppost in my house that I lick frequently

	I make a point of licking a different lamppost every time. I don't like to lick the same lamppost twice

	Of course, lampposts are strong just the way I like it

	No, but if I had a lamppost I would lick it

	I've never really thought about lampposts before

	I've picked a lot of things, but I haven't licked a lamppost

	*licked

	I can't lick a lamppost, I don't have a tongue 

	I did once, and then I was sore for hours afterwards

	I've licked a lamp, but never a lamppost

	I have too many lampposts. If I licked one then all the others would get jealous

	No, lampposts are evil. If I licked one I'd be stuck with it forever

	I considered licking a lamppost but then I decided I wasn't ready to make that commitment.

	Ok good cause that's all I've got lol

	Wow that was a lot lol

	What can I say lol

	In any given situation I can probably come up with a significant number of innuendos? Lol

	Yep lol

	I have to go now ttyl

	Hey

	Yeah

	Idk

	It's nothing

	Idk

	...

	It's just that I miss you

	I know that but it's not the same as you physically being here





	Yes I mean as a friend

	What do you mean?

	Besides the fact that I miss hugging you and talking to you (face to face) and just being in person with you?

	You didn't?

	Oh

	I thought I'd told you already pretty clearly how I felt lol but I guess not

	I was thinking about it earlier today and I was like "wait why do I miss him so badly but I don't feel as strongly about missing my family" and then I realized that while I do miss my family, that's easier to deal with. I can call them and talk to them when I want, and I know I'll see them again at Christmas and maybe thanksgiving too. But I don't know when I'll see you or talk to you (i.e., not through text) again

	You don't need to apologize

	It's not your fault

	You really don't need to

	Yeah 

	Yeah

	Ok

	Well I guess there is kind of one other thing but idk if I should say it

	In this case it's not something that would explode lol but ok I'll tell you

	Ok

	Ok

	...So I may or may not (by which I mean I'm not actually sure) have developed a crush on someone and I don't think he likes me back

	Because I've seen literally 0 signs that he likes me back and there are a few things that I could interpret as meaning he finds me annoying (although that would be overanalyzing. I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually dislike me, he just doesn't like me the way I like him)

	What

	Oh ok lol

	Ok

	Yeah

	Yeah





	It's nothing

	Ok if you insist

	Lol

	So I was talking earlier about how much I miss you and I was just thinking that it might be nice if we could talk some time (FaceTime or regular phone call)

	Well I wasn't thinking of right now but I mean if you wanted to I suppose I am free (although quiet hours start at 11:00 and I tend to talk loud so I'd probably have to go outside lol)

	Ok lol

	File Transfer: IMG_6958.PNGThis is my schedule. Not listed: chapel from 10:00-10:20 which I usually go to every weekday, vocal jazz from 7:30-9:00 on thursdays, on sundays I'm busy in the morning but usually free in the afternoon, on saturdays I'm typically free all da

	Yep lol

	Yep lol

	File Transfer: IMG_7083.PNGI was trying to phonetically translate my last name into Chinese and I figure "diyehe" would be the closest sound so I was looking to see if "gene" meant anything and I found this. Not quite what I was going for lol

	File Transfer: IMG_7087.PNGSmh I didn't fink people still used fanfiction.net lol

	I'm sorry that really sucks

	Why do you always say that

	I just don't understand why your response to something that bothers you is just to be like "no it's fine it's really not that big a deal". Actually I guess I can understand why you would say that but I'm just trying to say you don't have to act like things are okay if something's wrong. idk if that makes sense but yeah

	I'm sorry that's happened to you. You can be honest with me, you don't have to act like things are okay when they're not

	Yep

	Ok I have to go now ttyl

	I'm back

	yeah

	i just found out the guy i have a crush on already has a girlfriend

	i mean its not like i had a chance with him anyway

	yeah it sucks

	why do you say that

	Why is it true

	Lol if you say so

	Ok lol

	Lol yep

	Hmmmmm





	Idk lol

	Yep lo

	*lol

	Lol yep

	Lol

	Idk

	Why lol there’s nothing to be sorry for

	I have to do homework now ttyl

	Ok so I just realized I forgot to tell you a funny story from 2 days ago lol

	So I was doing swing dancing and there’s a portion for open dance and they had a mix of swing, blues, jazz, and line dance (by which I mean modern line dance, e.g. the cupid shuffle)

	So I was dancing with this guy and he’s like “alright we should move to the middle so we have enough space” and I’m like ok so we go to the middle and then realize there’s a group forming. Apparently there’s a line dance to Katy Perry’s “Hot and Cold” lol but neither of us knew it so we were just swing dancing off to the side lol

	What

	Oh yeah lol

	Swing dancing is a lot of fun lol

	It’s also nice bc since I’m a girl I just have to follow the guy’s lead so I don’t have to think too much about what to do I just have to be able to read and understand his cues lol

	What lol

	If you say so lol

	Smh lol tfw ur trying to take a test and half the class is sick lol

	Yep lol

	Ok lol ttyl

	hey

	Nvm ttyl

	Eh just feeling kinda meh rn

	Don't have time to talk I'm getting lunch rn

	Idk

	I will just let me finish lunch first

	Ok I'm back now. I'm feeling a lot better lol but we can still talk if you want lol

	So what's new lol

	Ok gimme a minute

	File Transfer: TheMachinationsofBrotherWashington.docx

	I think my favorite is either the severe respect (it was my desk he went up to lol since I’m front and center) or “Her man friend - is that worse? Her friend guy… her boyfriend. Do people still say that?”

	Speaking of history, I have a 2-3 page paper I have to write by wednesday and I really don’t wanna do it lol

	Easy for you to say lol you’re not the one who has to write it

	File Transfer: IMG_7112.PNGSo I know butt dialing is a thing but I guess with google docs butt typing is also a thing smh lol

	File Transfer: IMG_7112.PNGSo I know butt dialing is a thing but I guess with google docs butt typing is also a thing smh lol

	File Transfer: IMG_7119.JPG.jpegMy honors History/polisci cluster randomly decided to bring fruit to our history professor (we each took one apple or orange from the dining hall). He was actually pretty happy because apparently he didn't have any apples at home bc he hadn't gotten to the store yet lol

He was actually pretty happy because apparently he didn't have any apples at home bc he hadn't gotten to the store yet lol

	Ok so this next story is unrelated but it’s the same teacher lol

	Someone asked him “what’s the worst you’ve broken the rules” (or something along the lines of that)

	He said, “I snuck into the girls dorm… well, I didn’t sneak in, I just stayed late and so I had to sneak out wearing clothes that didn’t belong to me.” He said he had to hide his mustache lol

	Yep lol

	Lol yep

	Yeah lol

	What's up?

	Ok lol

	Lol yep

	Well I mean it's kinda hard to be really close when you live so far away and conversations are just "lol yep"

	Ok

	Nothing lol

	I gotta get some sleep lol goodnight





	Those were all nice things but they can't happen anymore now while I'm at college. I've made new friends and I'm busy with new classes (really busy smh these essays are killing me lol). I appreciate the time we spent but don't count on the present being like the past. I'm not saying we can't ever talk again, I'm just saying I'm not making any promises. Thought I'd let you know instead of just leaving you hanging.



Also after some space and distance I've realized some other things that need to be said. Sometimes (on those dates or otherwise) you would poke me even when I didn't want it. I wasn't always saying no, but moving away and at times even moving your hands away should have been a clear sign. The movies were nice, as was the hugging and cuddling, but I kind of felt pressured into the kissing (forehead kisses and quick kisses on the lips were ok, I'm talking more about the longer kisses) but I said yes bc I thought I wanted it and then later I realized I didn't actually want it but I wasn't willing to pull away idk and afterwards it just didn't feel right. Not terrible but just not right. But I liked the rest of the night well enough that I suggested it happen again. I'm telling you this not because I want you to feel bad or because I dislike you or anything like that, I just want you to know so that you don't do something like this in the future. Yes I could have been better at communicating and saying no, but also you can be asking for consent and paying attention for signs that somebody is not ok with what you are doing

	You're not terrible

	Just because you've made mistakes doesn't mean you're a terrible person

	I would keep trying to encourage you but I don't have a good response and it seems like you'll never believe me anyway so I guess this is it

	I'm eating breakfast rn

	I’m sorry that sucks. I really hope you can get the support you need but I’m just not sure I can provide it right now. I’ve been really stressed out with college lately (don’t really feel like typing out all the details) and I need to get on top of my classes right now. I’m sorry. Going to do homework now

	Emory, I think you’re a good guy and you’ve been a great friend. I enjoyed spending time with you and I really appreciated what we had. Hanging out and texting and all that was special for me too. It was a lot of fun and it also helped me get through some really difficult times. Now that I’m at college I’m really struggling with stress and classes and it’s difficult for me, but I’m getting help. I’m going to the counselor at the school and talking through my issues and getting help. I encourage you to do the same. Find someone (I would recommend finding a mental health professional since they have experience and training with this sort of stuff) who can help you. I don’t have the time to text you and always be there for you now, but someone else can be. And as for the stuff I said earlier about the poking and the kissing, it’s really not a huge deal. I just wanted to let you know.

	Nice. They have good food there lol

	Where to?

	Lol

	My cousin got married on Friday and my family came for the wedding so that was fun lol

	And no

	Oh yeah lol

	I know lol

	If you say so lol

	You don’t have anyone to hug?

	I’m sorry that sucks

	I’m sorry that sucks

	Computer Science

	Lol

	Get a job lol, beyond that idk. I’ve got 4 years to figure it out lol

	Idk

	Nothing lol

	I’m fine right now lol. Last week I was stressing out a lot about this paper I had to write for my honors history/polisci class but I turned that in so that’s done lol. School is still kinda crazy but yeah I’m doing fine right now. It also probably helps that I spent a weekend hanging out with my family and having fun lol

	They went up for my cousin’s wedding and also to see me

	My grandma and some of my aunts and uncles and cousins live in Michigan, and a lot of my relatives on my mom’s side came to Grand Rapids for the wedding.

	I’m kinda neutral on that lol. If it’s just “lol yep” and “yep lol” back and forth with no substance then nah, but if you actually have stuff to say then if I’m not busy sure I’ll be happy to talk (and if I am busy I’ll reply eventually when I’m not as busy)

	Lol true

	I’m sorry that sucks

	Yeah lol

	Lol

	Wow lol

	You should probably get that checked out though lol, 8 bloody noses in a day sounds bad

	Lol

	That you made a face out of blood and the teacher was just like “ok” lol

	Lol

	Which teacher and class was this anyway lol

	Lol

	Why didn’t you take AP?

	That's what I did lol. Well good luck with apush and English honors lol

	Cool lol

	Ok lol

	Hey lol

	My 11:30 Polisci class and my 12:30 history class were both cancelled today so I only had my 2:30 cs class lol. I still had to walk all the way across campus to get my paper back though. I thought it was a C but it turned out to be an A so that's cool. Have to write the next paper now though lol. First I'm gonna go for a walk/run though since it's really nice out. (I won't text you while I'm doing that, but we can resume this conversation later)

	It's colder here lol. It's 37 degrees here (41 in fairfax). It snowed on Saturday so I had to finally get my winter clothes out of the trunk room

	File Transfer: IMG_7229.JPGIn other news, I'm so done with my Chinese textbook rn smh

	File Transfer: IMG_7229.JPGIn other news, I'm so done with my Chinese textbook rn smh

	It's alright lol

	In case you were wondering, this is what I answered based on my own opinions and what I know how to say in Chinese: "I think that the most ideal boyfriend is a good person. His temper is patient. I don't want to deal with an impatient person. He is easy to get along with. He likes to make jokes but he's also willing to discuss serious ["important" is the word I used] things with me. Our interests don't have to be the same, but if our interests are a little bit similar [ie if we have some interests in common] that's good." And then I decided I was done writing.





	Oh yeah I need to see that lol

	What?

	I'm sorry that sucks

	I'm going to breakfast now ttyl

	It's ok. And to be clear I was going to go to breakfast at that time anyway; there's no correlation between what you said and me going to breakfast

	Yep lol

	I'm sorry that sucks

	Ok

	I sent my polisci prof a super long email asking questions about the next paper and this morning he just sent out an email saying him and the history prof will have an optional joint session today to discuss the paper (some people are kind of annoyed because we didn’t know about this until today and they’ve already made plans i.e. gone home for thanksgiving). I’m wondering if in this case correlation equals causation lol

	I’m wondering if they called the session because of my email. Maybe the prof was like “smh this is too long to read” or “hmm so many questions maybe this should be discussed in person” or something lol

	The message is more than a page long (12pt font)

	Yeah lol

	Ok lol





	Ok lol

	Smh nothing quite like getting back home and remembering why I was so eager to leave in the first place lol

	It's not too bad, just a bit of arguing between my parents about where we're going for dinner

	What lol

	Yeah lol

	What happened?

	Go on...

	That's weird lol

	Idk just that it's weird

	In other news, I'm so glad I don't have to do smartmusic anymore

	That's rough lol

	Smh why does my mom have to yell at my brother while I'm in the house

	She yelled at him about not practicing smartmusic enough before submitting out

	*it

	I’ll live

	Lol

	Yay I’m finally going to eat

	Lol

	You're not the one going to dinner lol

	Nvm I have to wait 15 minutes before we leave and then it takes 30 minutes to get there

	Busboys&poets

	It’s in dc

	brb there’s banana bread to eat

	Busy with school. Maybe will have time to talk in a few weeks idk

	Hey lol



	Finals stress almost killed me lol

	I'm just glad I'm finally feeling better. When I say it almost killed me I'm not exaggerating as much as you might think smh lol

	Yeah I know lol

	I'd been dealing with some depression and anxiety and just general stress and I was seeing a psychologist which seemed to help but then there was a long break before my next appointment and in the meantime things just sort of escalated and it took me a while to realize what was going on and how bad it was and be convinced to go get help

	I went into the nurse on Thursday bc I was really depressed and I couldn't sleep or focus on my schoolwork and I was plagued by intrusive thoughts of death and I noticed signs of self harm

	Friday was my scheduled appointment with the psychologist and then after that I went to the nurse and I got put on medication for depression, anxiety, and OCD (I'm diagnosed with all three. I may also have ADD, but they're not sure)

	The weekend passed in a blur of depression, anxiety, exhaustion, confusion, and paranoia. And I didn't accomplish any of the stuff I was planning to do. Nor did I relax

	I was sleepwalking on Monday morning and it took me an hour to eat breakfast and I wasn't mentally there for any of my classes. I went to the nurse again and she reminded me I could ask for accommodations on the grounds of mental disability

	I asked my Polisci prof about the possibility of an extension bc I couldn't think (I'd mentioned anxiety to him before), and he said I could have one if I needed it but that he was sure I would do fine since I got an A on the last two papers

	That really helped. From then on I felt significantly better but I had to catch up on all the work I missed. Still haven't finished my Polisci essay lol

	I appreciate your concern but it's not your fault. I was already talking to my mom about all this stress and she was doing the best she could to help me but we agreed I needed outside help. It's not a case of needing someone to text every time something goes wrong, it's the fact that my brain chemistry is messed up (that's what the medicine is supposed to help with), I don't have healthy coping mechanisms (that's what the psychologist is going to help me with and what I'll practice myself), and college is stressful (that part is inevitable)

	It's a research design about which consequence of state failure is the most pertinent and how different IR theories apply to that consequence. I have the basic outline and wrote everything I can think of but it's 3 pages and 1 paragraph, and it's supposed to be 5-8 pages

	So what's new with you lol

	Btw I'm in airport to fly home rn so if I don't respond it's probably bc my plane arrived



	Yeah. My last final was yesterday but my paper is due Tuesday

	I also have a history paper due Monday but I just sort of threw some stuff together and called it good lol

	It's very not me. I had the assignment for weeks but I just couldn't write it

	It will be/is a relief to feel like myself again

	It's funny, for finals I worked ahead on the stress and procrastinated on the actual work

	The crazy thing is none of my friends know about this. The time that I started feeling worse is the same time I began to withdraw from the few friends I had and avoid socializing. The only people who know what happened are my family, the nurse, the psychologist, my roommate, and now you. Sometimes I'm like maybe I should tell my friends but at the same time what's the point. Thankfully once I started feeling better I began socializing again and it was like I had never left (i.e. I didn't lose any friendships, I just didn't grow in them or make new ones)

	 I know

	I just mean they didn't know about how bad it got recently 

	It's not your fault 

	Boarding now

	Ttyl

	And btw all the stuff I said earlier, I didn't say it to make you feel bad or guilty or whatever, I just wanted to tell someone who would understand and also to let you know that there is hope. Even when everything really sucks it can and will get better

	Ok cool

	You didn't answer my earlier question though. What's new with you lol

	Which class

	Oh yeah I remember that class lol. In 10th grade when I was new to Fairfax I jumped into honors precalc despite having never taken an honors math class. It was awful. I dropped out after first quarter into regular

	That's rough lol 

	Who's your teacher?

	Idk who that is lol

	I'm sorry that sucks

	That really sucks

	How's band? Are you doing jazz band again this year?

	Nice lol. Do you like it?

	Either one lol

	Ikr I hated last year when dr L took the fun out of everything I'm like smh chill (not that I told him that of course lol). What about big band?

	Dr L is worse or big band is worse?

	Oh ok lol. Dr H is still doing big band though right? How do you like that?

	That's good lol. Did you guys have a concert yet?

	When is the next one lol

	Ok lol

	I haven't done band since I left for college, but I did join a vocal jazz club. We had a concert on dec. 6. It was cool lol

	Ikr lol. I wanna do it again next semester but it seems like it's going to be a lot more involved so I'm not sure I'll have the time (especially since I'm getting a job that will take 4 hours a week lol. I only have 14 credit hours (compared to this semester's 16.5 credit hours) though so I might be able to) 

	I'd be a facilitator for Girls Who Code. Basically it means that along with one other Calvin student (who I happen to already know) I would help lead a 3 hour a week coding session for girls (either middle school or high school age, I forget). Well not so much lead as give them the general guidelines and help them when they have questions (thus the title "facilitator"). The other hour is the estimated prep time

	I have some experience answering people's code questions since I was the lab assistant for my intro cs class for some of this semester

	And yes it's a job

	No it's fine lol

	I'm sure lol

	How long am I home?

	Interim starts on January 4, so I leave January 3

	Yep lol

	I was actually just thinking of asking you the same thing. A movie sounds nice, though if you want to catch up idk if that's the best choice since we can't actually talk lol

	Not yet but I can think about it lol

	I'm not sure. I'm busy tomorrow and Sunday (and Christmas Eve, Christmas, and New Years) but idk if my family has plans any other days

	Oh and dec 23 is also out

	How about Tuesday dec 20?

	Ok. What about Wednesday dec 21?

	But are you free besides that?

	K

	Yeah I'm free then

	File Transfer: IMG_7304.PNGFile Transfer: IMG_7305.PNGRogue one has a bunch of showings, or we could do something else

	File Transfer: IMG_7304.PNGFile Transfer: IMG_7305.PNGRogue one has a bunch of showings, or we could do something else

	Rogue one has a bunch of showings, or we could do something else



	You already saw it?

	Nice lol

	Good question lol

	That could work. Where do you wanna go for dinner?

	Lol if you say so

	Hmm ok I'll see what's around

	Well if you want to go to the movie right after dinner then we could go to coastal flats since that's right by the theater. Or we could go to a movie and then dinner. Whichever order you prefer

	Where would you need to be picked up?

	Oh right I forgot all those lol

	Potbelly sounds good

	Ok cool. Dinner before or after the movie?

	I would say the 7:00 showing makes the most sense, unless you want to change the meal to lunch and go to the 12:30 showing

	Ok so dinner and then the 7:00 showing?

	What time do you want to meet for dinner?

	Right lol

	So how much time do we want?

	On what?

	Idk

	Yeah that's what I figured

	So what are you saying lol

	True lol

	Yeah lol

	Idk lol what do you think

	Lol if you say so

	Ok then lol

	Idk I usually leave like an hour for meals just to be sure but idk if that seems like a reasonable amount of time for you

	Ok so what time should I pick you up?

	7:00

	It's alright lol 

	That's what I was asking you lol. Idk how long it takes to get to your house and from your house to potbelly

	lol true 

	K

	Yeah lol

	K

	Ok lol

	Yeah lol

	You didn't give me your address yet smh lol 

	*shoves back*

	It says it's an 8 minute drive 

	So if I leave some time between 5:30 and 5:45 that should be good to get us to dinner at 6:00 so we can get to the movie by 7:00

	Idk lol

	My dog keeps running away from me smh I just want to pet her lol

	It's not so much that Roxy is actually running it's more just that she keeps leaving me lol

	I don't think that's the problem I think I'm giving her more attention than she's comfortable with but idk lol

	What's that supposed to mean lol

	Both lol

	I doubt that but ok lol

	Oh ok

	That's too bad lol

	Sorry this is bad timing lol but I'm actually going to bed too goodnight

	Hey lol

	Nothing much lol

	Hmmm ok let me see if I can find when that’s playing

	It’s not showing at fairfax corner. Which theaters should I be looking at?

	I just mean which theaters are nearby and affordable lol

	Yeah it is lol

	Does Tuesday work for you? If we go to Bow Tie Cinemas (in Reston, google maps says it’s a little over 20 minutes drive from my house and near potbelly) on Tuesday (that’s their discount day) there’s a 6:00 showing or a 9:10 showing

	You’re busy on tuesday?

	Ok

	I thought it was monday that you can’t do

	Ok

	Well we were gonna aim for dinner at 6:00 right? And it’s supposed to take about 20 minutes to get to your house I think. So I’ll plan to leave at 5:30. So you can expect me there at about 5:50 (basically just some time between 5:30 and 6:00). Does that work for you?

	Lol

	Yeah lol

	Sorry I’m really bad at checking notifications on my computer lol

	Yeah lol

	Hmmmmm

	They all look good to me lol

	Idk lol

	Ok lol

	Playing video games lol

	I’m playing a game called Reigns

	It’s a game where you’re a king and you say yes or no to questions people ask you and you’re trying to keep in balance the levels of the church, the people, the army, and the treasury because if any of them gets too high or too low then you die

	Could be lol

	Lol true

	Yep lol

	Hmmmmmm

	Lol

	Idk lol

	Lol

	Hmmmmmmm

	Yep lol 

	Hmmmmmmm

	Yep lol

	Wait what

	Oh ok lol

	Yep lol

	Lol yep

	Yep lol

	Hmmmmm

	Hmmmmm

	Hmmmmmmmmmmm

	Slight change of plans. My mom is giving us a ride (and dropping us off. After the movie one of my parents can pick us up) bc she needs the car. We have to stop to get air in the tires first and then we'll head over to your house. Will let you know when we are there

	Yep lol

	Lol hmmmmm

	What lol

	We actually skipped getting air in the tires. Gps says we'll get there 5:45

	I'll let you know

	We're here

	What lol

	Ok lol

	Good lol

	Yep lol

	It's fine lol

	Yes I'm sure lol. Like I said, if there was anything I was uncomfortable with, I would have let you know

	It's fine, really 

	Yep lol

	Lol yep

	Hmmmmm

	Yep lol 

	Hmmmmm

	Lol

	I'm going to bed now lol goodnight 

	Hey lol

	I got a neck massager lol

	Why there was one at the grocery store idk but whatever lol

	I haven't decided yet if it's for me or if I'm gonna give it to a family member for Christmas

	It's a neck massager

	Ok lol

	Lol

	Yeah lol

	What?

	What?

	Are you sure?

	Ok if you say so

	Ok then lol

	🤔

	Idk lol

	What do you mean lol

	It was good lol

	Didn't we have this discussion last night?

	I guess I didn't communicate clearly enough. In the past some of the poking was too much and you didn't recognize my signals that I wanted a break from the poking. The kissing felt a little weird and I didn't want anymore of it. The poking last night was fine, you could have poked more and still been fine (I was surprised how little you poked me, I didn't realize until you texted me how you were still concerned about it being too much or whatever)

	Yep lol

	Lol yep

	*stands bc I want to feel tall lol*

	*jumps onto your shoulders*

	Yeah lol

	Lolhmmmm

	Yeah lol

	I was at a friend's house. I'm back now lol 

	Yep lol

	Yeah lol

	🤔

	Yeah lol

	Idk lol

	Yep lol

	Lol yep

	Hey lol

	What’s up lol

	Ok lol

	Lol true

	Yep lol

	Yeah lol

	Yeah lol

	Bc I can’t think of anything to say and I got bored of saying “yep lol”

	There’s no need to apologize

	I suck at conversation too lol

	It takes two people to hold a conversation and I’m not particularly good at it lol

	If you come up with something let me know

	Ok

	You didn't ruin anything 

	I'm sorry. If I think of actual conversation I'll let you know but for now I just don't see any point in saying nothing

	Goodnight

	Hey. You still there?

	I actually thought of something to talk about I mean idk but given what you said earlier I figure it's better than nothing lol

	Ok cool

	Let me preface this by saying I wasn't even really planning to say something I just figured hey may as well lol

	So there's this guy I met at college...

	And once I started getting to know him (late September I think) and we started hanging out more I got a really big crush on him

	No this is a different guy

	Anyways so my friends kept teasing about how we must totally be dating and that annoyed me bc I wasn't sure how he felt about me or how I felt about dating and I didn't want to rush into things

	And then lack of sleep (bc I stayed up late hanging out with him lol) led to increased stress in schoolwork (this is all earlier in the year still btw) so I kinda withdrew

	And then I got my life back on track again and started hanging out with him some but not as much as before and I still liked him but I didn't have a crush on him anymore I didn't think

	And then more recently as I got more stressed I withdrew from everyone including him and that made me sad

	And then on Thursday (the day before I flew out) when I was feeling better I messaged him asking if he wanted to hang out and so we did and it was just like before as if nothing bad had ever happened

	And then I kinda realized actually I do still like him as more than a friend but I don't think he feels that way about me but I mean idk if I even want a dating relationship anyway and we already hang out and hug and cuddle and all that and I mean we haven't really had much in terms of deep conversations yet but I feel like if we wanted to we could do that so I mean it's kinda like well what else could I ask for you know lol

	The majority of me says to be happy with the way things are but there's still like that tiny part of me that says it would be nice to date him, to flirt with him, to be his girlfriend, to hold hands, etc. I think I'll just stick with the way things are though lol, it's pretty nice lol

	True lol

	So yeah that's that

	I may or may not bring up questions or comments or additional info about this later idk lol

	Not exactly

	Not everyone is comfortable with that level of physical affection and I don't want to assume but also I don't want to ask bc that feels awkward lol

	Cool

	So?

	Basically the only people I'm that close with physically 1) I like a fair bit (platonically, romantically, or both) and 2) are comfortable with that. Usually this means I'm only that close with guys I like. It's not something I do with everyone; I can only think of 2 (maybe 3 or 4? I don't remember the other two well enough to be certain) other guys besides you who I've been close with physically, and I can only think of 1 (maybe 2) girls I've been close with (not nearly as close) physically

	Oh I see yeah

	Hand holding is nice in and of itself, it doesn't have to only happen as part of a relationship

	A lot of people do, that's a reasonable assumption but it's not the one I was making in that particular situation

	Speaking of hands, my fingers hurt from all this typing lol. I think I've said all I want to say for now so goodnight lol. Talk to you later (i.e. when one of us can think of a conversation starter lol)

	That sounds frustrating lol

	Oh ok lol

	Ok lol

	Merry Christmas!🎁🎄 

	hey

	My dad can't be calm for one day he's just yelling and complaining like every day since I came back (well I mean probably every day while I was gone too)

	The classic "everybody needs to leave on time" from the person who's always late and this time he's actually on time and everyone else is late so he's being all self righteous and complaining

	And I'm in the car so I can't escape from his negativity

	Note to self: next time bring headphones 

	It's ok. Sorry to tell you all this on Christmas you should be enjoying the day lol

	Can I get a hug lol

	*hugs back*

	*hugs more*

	So how's Christmas been for you so far?

	Ok cool

	How were the presents?

	Nice lol

	We haven't even opened stockings yet lol

	Yeah lol

	It's bc my sister wanted to sleep in and then we went to the Christmas Day service (usually it's a Christmas Eve service but Christmas is on a Sunday this year)

	Yeah lol

	Lol

	Idk lol

	Lol wow how did it taste?

	Nice lol

	Good lol

	Yeah lol

	Lol wow

	What?

	True lol

	Lol true

	Lol yep

	*pokes back*

	*more poke*

	You beat me to it lol

	Tfw u have to file for federal, Virginia, and Michigan taxes smh lol (actually though I might not have to file for Michigan taxes bc I didn’t earn much money in Michigan this year lol)

	My dad is angry and yelling at everyone again argh. But we got the dog back from the kennel (we were gone on vacation for a few days) so that’s good lol

	New England. I have family in Massachusetts and Rhode Island

	That sucks. What’s the assignment about?

	Wow that does sound hard

	Yeah that sucks I’m sorry

	What’s that lol

	What’s the solution lol

	Nice lol

	Lol

	*hugs you*

	*more hugs* I’m sorry that sucks

	*keeps hugging* Are you sure?

	Ok *hugs more*

	*more hug*

	Yep lol

	I can’t wait to go back to college and get away from my dad smh

	Not terrible but bad enough that I’m like “ugh”. Not that it takes much to get to that point though smh I get frustrated with his attitude very quickly

	Something like that yeah

	It’s ok, I’m going back tomorrow so I have less than 24 hours of frustration left lol

	Yeah lol

	Tfw the airline waits until shortly before the plane is supposed to leave to tell u that ur flight is cancelled due to "crew availability" (shouldn't they have known this ahead of time?) and the next flight departs at 7:30am which means leaving the house at 5:30am and missing the first hour or more of ur class on the first day

	My flight got cancelled

	So now I have to get up really early to get on a flight that still won't get me to campus in time for my class. Well, I should be there for some of it but I'll miss the first hour or so

	Unless you have a private jet or a helicopter or something I don't think you can help

	yeah

	*sighs*

	*hugs back*

	yeah

	Idk I don't think there's anything you can do 

	It's not your fault 

	Ok

	Also I found out my interim class was changed from the one I signed up for to some different one (bc the one I signed up for was recently cancelled) but I didn't get any notification or anything 

	And I don't like the class it changed to

	Some bible class that I'm not interested in

	I'll go to the first day of class and if I don't like it I'm going to the registrar and asking for them to move me into another (closed) class I saw that I find interesting that's based on resting and learning about yourself and all that. I figure if I petition on the grounds of mental health I have a good chance of getting in

	Yes they should have 

	It's ok I'm going to bed now anyways goodnight 

	Lol welcome to winter

	No surprise there lol

	Mental state not good. The psychiatrist told me two days ago I need to go home and get better so I can come back for fall semester. I only have a few days left. Wasn't planning on or expecting this. Don't want to talk about it right now need to get through interim first. Goodnight. 

	hey

	It's just difficult suddenly being at home and dealing with patterns and thoughts (the OCD) I've had for a long time. I know there are no simple answers and it's probably best not to delve in too deep bc I've noticed it can be very easy for me to get into a repetitive cycle of venting and asking for validation/reassurance which doesn't accomplish anything and actually makes things worse in the long term. I mean it's not like it sucks all the time but it can be tiring and confusing but that doesn't mean give up. Ok I think that's about all I have to say about it. If you have specific questions I don't mind answering but otherwise it's probably best to move on

	Right now I'm catching up on the episodes of Sherlock I never got around to watching lol

	I plan to go back for the fall semester. Until then I'll be here at home

	Idk

	It's ok. I'm watching Sherlock rn so that's abt all that's new

	Nah I'm good

	Cool lol

	Fantastic beasts was pretty good 

	On winter break 

	I'm busy watching this episode so ttyl

	Hey

	Smh I keep sleeping in so bad lol. My alarm went off at 7am and I was like "nope" and didn't get up until 8:45

	It is for me lol

	If I don't set an alarm then I wake up too early or just lie in bed all day. Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is good for mood, energy, and health but it's still hard to stick to it lol

	Consistency in when you sleep and what your  morning and nighttime routines, getting the right amount of sleep, and waking up at the right time in your sleep cycle all matter

	Bc sleep is important lol without good sleep you can't function as well. I've done my research but that doesn't mean I always follow it lol

	Sleeping well, eating right, and exercising right are all things that affect mood and health that I can control to some extent. But sometimes I have trouble not obsessing over doing them perfectly lol (ok lbr I could definitely be better at exercising lol)

	Let's be real

	I went to church. Have a little time now before the potluck

	Why are you sorry?

	No I'm fine lol I was just stating a fact. And even if I was annoyed that doesn't mean you need to apologize you did nothing wrong

	Oh ok

	So what's new with you lol

	The auto show is cool lol

	At least I'm guessing it was lol

	Fair enough lol

	When you say "super mixed signals" do you mean like when you were still dating and you were calling me cute and all that but you had to make sure people didn't "get the wrong idea"? Lol

	What kind of problems lol

	Oh ok. Does she not talk with her boyfriend about that stuff?

	Ok lol

	No need to apologize

	Not much. I might start learning to knit soon so that's cool. My pe class starts next Tuesday. I went to the chocolate festival yesterday so that was fun lol. And that's about all the excitement in my life lol not much is going on lol

	Yeah lol. It's still going on today

	Nope lol

	Well that sucks

	That's really frustrating

	*hugs you*

	I'll be at fairfax hs tomorrow to vote for mayor so let me know if you want to say hi some time tomorrow (just say when and where) lol

	Not much lol

	I'm back now but I'll go to bed when I get home lol

	Idk like 20 minutes or so?

	Lol

	I went to an OCD support group in Alexandria (that's where I was for the past 2 hours lol). It wasn't super enlightening or anything but it was nice to meet and hear from people dealing with similar problems.

	Yeah lol

	Idk I'm almost home lol

	Smh tfw ur mom is like "whatever you do, don't lose the Tokyo Disney umbrella" but u lost the Tokyo Disney umbrella months ago and never told them o.0

	Nah

	Idk I just know that a while ago I realized I didn't know where it was

	So did you want to see me tomorrow? I'll be going over with my mom at 8am unless there's a different time you think works better

	Idk what that is supposed to mean 

	Well I'll go to whatever room I'm supposed to go in to vote, and then I'll go wherever so wherever you find most convenient should work for me

	Ok that should work

	Goodnight 

	It'll be a little after 8 unless I go there first. When does class start?

	Ok I'll go to the cafeteria first

	Almost to school. Will go to cafeteria as soon as I get out of car 

	Ok well maybe we should hang out another time then I'm still stuck in traffic lol

	Wow lol

	What are the other reasons lol

	Alright then lol

	Haha ok lol

	Alright lol

	Maybe lol

	Only one of the movies out right now is one I’m interested in: La La Land. Beauty and the Beast is also a movie I want to see but that doesn’t come out until march

	That does make it hard to get a movie ticket

	It’s ok

	Ok

	It’s ok

	I got no ideas lol

	Yeah lol

	Idk lol

	Yeah lol

	Nah

	Don’t you have class lo

	*lol

	Idk what to talk about though lol

	Do you have any ideas of what I could write a Python program for? I want to write a program but I have no ideas smh lol

	A lot of things lol. It’s particularly good at string manipulation. It can also work with data. And it’s object oriented.

	That’s ok lol

	Idk lol

	Boring but other than that fine lol

	I have nothing to do lol

	It’s fine lol

	Ok

	Yeah I just can’t think of anything to say lol

	You don’t need to apologize

	Yes

	*poke poke*

	*pokes your arm*

	*poke*

	It’s ok

	I’m fine lol I just can’t think of anything to say lol

	Idk lol

	*shoves back*

	*shoves*

	*poke*

	*kicks back*

	What do you mean lol

	Sure lol

	*pokes*

	Smh lol

	LOl

	Idk lol

	*pokes*

	Lol *poke*

	Idk lol *shove*

	Smh tfw there’s not really anything good to eat at home but u don’t wanna spend money to eat out lol

	*kick*

	What lol

	What do you mean lol

	What do you mean lol

	No I’ll just eat food and be like “meh this isn’t very good” smh lol I’m not going to starve

	Nah lol

	*poke*

	What happened lol

	Lol

	Nothing much lol

	Sure lol

	What lol

	Idk lol

	Idk lol

	*Lays next to you*

	What lol

	Hey lol

	Nice lol

	I'm watching a musical on YouTube 

	Firebringer (it's by Starkid, the same group that made A Very Potter Musical)

	Yeah lol

	*pokes back*

	*poke*

	Nothing lol

	Yeah lol

	*poke*

	Hey lol

	Omg lol how

	Lol

	Nice lol

	I bought a textbook

	History of film and animation. And actually I didn't buy it I just rented it

	Yeah lol

	Idk lol something in computer science

	Probably not IT. Probably computer programming

	Ok lol

	That is actually one of the things I'm considering. I need more background knowledge though lol

	Lol

	Ok lol 

	Hey lol

	Nothing much lol

	That must be frustrating

	Right

	Of course

	You don’t need to apologize

	You don’t have to

	Ok (Idk what to say to that)

	*sits down*

	*lays down on my back*

	*rolls over onto my stomach*

	*pokes back*

	Well at least now you know what an unhealthy relationship is so that it will be easier to avoid it in the future

	That sucks

	You don’t need to apologize

	Idk

	What were you drinking lol

	Lol

	That’s good lol

	Lol

	Wow lol

	Lol

	That’s good lol

	It’ll be twice as expensive since it isn’t discount day

	Like $7.45 I think?

	Yeah but I’d rather go on a Wednesday or at least not on a Friday bc my family usually has pizza and watches a movie at home together on Fridays

	Wednesday after 5 would work best, but I might be able to do Sunday night if wednesday doesn’t work

	If it’s the case of you needing a ride, I could probably give you a ride

	Oh ok

	Ok

	Well I can’t do tuesday evenings but besides that I’m good

	Ok lol

	Wednesday evening would work best

	Ok so if Wednesday doesn’t work then we can do sunday

	Ok that makes sense

	Ok

	It’s ok

	Well lets look at the showtimes and prices

	$11 (matinee) to go on Sunday at 3:30, $12.75 to go on Sunday at 7:10 or 10:25, or $5.75 to go on Wednesday. I also found out that “early bird” (Idk exactly what the cutoff time for that is) is cheaper. If we go at 12:30 on Saturday, it’s only $6.50 so that’s not too much more expensive than discount day.

	On this specific saturday or just in general?

	Well it looks like the movie is only in the theatre until next thursday, so if you can’t do the saturday early bird then we should do wednesday or the sunday matinee, since I’m guessing you can’t do 12:30 on a weekday

	Ok if you’re sure

	I can’t do 12:30 on Sunday, so it would have to be the 3:30 one if we were to go on Sunday

	Yeah lol

	Ok good to know

	Ok

	Lol

	I don’t mind tbh. Sometimes I get envious and sometimes I think it’s cute and sometimes I don’t care lol

	Sounds good lol

	Haha ok lol

	Yes I'm fine with that it was a fine question lol I just didn't answer bc I was taking a bath. I'm going to bed now lol goodnight

	Hey lol

	Was that what we decided?

	Ok yeah that should work

	$11. Which is why I'd prefer Wednesday

	If you're ok with that

	Alright if you say so lol

	Yeah bc then it's $5.75 instead of $11

	Ok

	Lol

	What?

	Ok then

	You don't need to apologize 

	I went over to a friend's house and brought my dog. It's cool lol. Except now I'm bored but I can't go home yet bc I came with John and he doesn't want to go home yet smh

	Nah I'm ok lol

	Idk what to talk about 

	What do you want to talk about?

	I'm sorry that sucks 

	Oh

	John says there is a jazz band concert this Wednesday?

	So I guess that means Wednesday is probably not a good night to also see a movie then

	Then let's go with Sunday

	What do you mean you shouldn’t be allowed to be sad? It’s ok to be sad

	I’m really sorry that must be very frustrating

	Just remember, you won’t have to live with your parents forever

	Is there anything in particular you need help with?

	Well idk about band (good luck with that communication?), I never took APUSH, and I suck at physics, but if you need help in precalc or English I might be able to help you

	So just let me know if you need help. I have time lol

	Well if there are particular problems, essays, etc. you’re having trouble with, I can help you out

	Ok

	I’m sorry that sucks

	Who is your teacher?

	Oh I don’t know that teacher

	Why are you apologizing?

	It’s ok

	You don't need to apologize

	File Transfer: IMG_7396.PNG

	Just something to consider

	Nothing much is new lol. I'm gonna buy yarn today and go look at cats to adopt lol

	No you didn't. Do you have pics?

	Cute lol

	What's its name?

	Lol from overwatch right?

	Lol nice

	We had a cat when we first got Roxy. She wasn't super happy about it but she put up with it lol

	Pretty much lol

	Yeah that should work

	Yeah why

	Yeah I just don’t like driving much lol

	True lol

	Yeah sure

	Nothing much lol

	Yeah lol

	Yes lol

	No kissing, don't poke so hard it hurts (I'll tell you if it hurts), but other than that anything goes pretty much lol

	Lol

	Ok lol

	Same lol

	It's ok lol

	Idk lol

	lol what 

	Lol

	Oh ok lol

	Ok lol

	Ok lol

	Lol

	*poke poke*

	Hey lol

	Just about to eat lunch lol

	What time do you want me to pick you up? The movie starts at 3:30

	K

	I'm heading over now. See you in about 10 minutes

	I'm here 

	Hey lol

	What's up lol

	You guys sounded good 

	In other news, I want to murder my parents

	Ok maybe not literally but I am really mad at them

	Nothing much, just a buildup of the constant criticism I've had to endure over the past few weeks, and all of my concerns are dismissed because they insist criticizing me and giving me a bunch of stupid difficult meaningless tasks is important to me and how I feel about it doesn't matter

	I don't want to be here. I want to be back at college already. This sucks

	I wish I hadn't come home because I hate living at home I'm always angry when I'm around my parents and it feels like everything I do is terrible and meaningless and everything they say reinforces that

	Saying "I love you" doesn't erase the negativity I'm sick of them trying to act like they know what's in my best interests better than I do

	I just hate it all

	Both are stressful, but college is more meaningful and fulfilling whereas the stress at home seems pointless

	They think they need to point out all my flaws as if I don't know them myself, and they seem to think it's their responsibility to get me to fix everything, despite the fact that that's what got me into this mess in the first place

	It seems like everything I do no matter how I do it is wrong in their eyes

	What really sucks is I think that they (or at least my mom) honestly think they're helping and they dismiss any backlash or negative feedback

	I hate them so much

	They're usually not that bad, but ever since I came home they've been awful

	Yeah

	*hugs*

	*hugs*

	*hug*

	Eh

	Idk

	Ok but still idk

	Kinda meh

	Idk

	File Transfer: IMG_7403.JPGOn a more positive note, I learned how to fingerknit today

	File Transfer: IMG_7403.JPGOn a more positive note, I learned how to fingerknit today

	If you want me to make anything for you, I have plenty of yarn

	I could do a headband or a scarf. That's about the limit of my abilities rn lol

	What color? I have that purple/blue gradient, pink, maroon, and green

	K

	Do you want it thin and long, or short and fat?

	Lol

	It's like 8ft long or so I think and like an inch wife. Is that good or should I keep going?

	I was already making one when I asked if you wanted one so I decided it would just be for you

	So when do you want me to bring you your scarf?

	I hate my parents so much I need to get the heck out of here I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next few months

	More of the usual, them criticizing me while saying it's in my best interest and that they love me

	Yes but they dismiss all my concerns 

	I know

	I'll see the therapist on Tuesday so I'm going to tell him then to talk to my parents

	I hate my mom so much I'm so sick of this

	I’m so angry I hate this all

	It's ok

	Yeah 

	Nah

	Parents lecturing sucks

	Yeah

	No I don't think that's fair I'm sorry that happened

	Hey

	Nothing much lol 

	Nah lol

	Nah lol

	*poke*

	Yeah like once it's expensive though

	Oh ok cool

	Maybe

	I'll see what's on

	With a student discount, tickets are 12.69 per person, so your card would almost cover it. Available movies that I care about are the Lego batman movie (but I’d probably just wait until it comes out on dvd) or Beauty and the Beast. Beauty and the Beast is showing at fairfax corner (rave) for cheaper though. I’ll be going to see that at some theater or other I also saw that in a few weeks a sci-fi movie called Life is coming out that looks interesting if you want to wait for that.

	Yeah I figured

	Well I'm sure you'll have time between now and two weeks from now to find a preview of the movie and decide if it looks interesting

	Lol true

	How's it going?

	Lol

	I'm bored lol

	How was your snow day?

	Nice lol

	I've had 3 pajama days in a row (yesterday I actually went to the store and also to a d&d game still in my pajamas)

	Today I finally got dressed smh lol

	I have this hoodie I bought recently that I really like except that it's too short so like my torso is warm down to my belly button and then it's just my shirt lol :(

	D&d is a lot of fun. This time (my second session), instead of almost dying I actually did pretty well. I sang a lullaby to crying babies and rolled a nat 20 and they all calmed down almost like they were hypnotized. I also sang "I need a hero" to inspire the townspeople to stop the fire in the tavern. And I found a more efficient way to fill buckets of water. I also successfully retrieved ingredients so our ranger needed one less turn to save the dying horses. (Also one of our monks (we have two) was literally beating a dead horse smh)

	I think the hoodie is for young girls so that's probably why it's a weird fit. And I got it on clearance so I'm just stuck with it

	Well just know that it's fun and weird. And btw a natural 20 is the highest you can roll so it  usually means whatever you try to do goes really well

	You still there?

	No problem

	I have a picture gimme a minute lol

	File Transfer: IMG_7519.JPG

	Me too lol that's why I bought it

	Yeah probably lol

	Changing the subject a bit, remember when I told you a while ago about the guy I met at college who I like? Well I've kind of realized that I still have a crush on him and am still thinking about him even though he's so far away but it sucks bc like the timing is really bad and idk if I should say anything but part of me is afraid like what if he gets a girlfriend while I'm gone? But I mean what good does it do to tell him now idk it's just hard smh

	Quite possibly yeah

	I mean idk for sure

	The school has a page where you can anonymously post about your crush at the school and I lowkey kinda wanna use that to post about him and see how he responds but idk

	I could just talk to him about it I'm just kinda nervous and idk lol

	Don't post on the page? Yeah that's too public even though it's anonymous

	Yeah that's true I suppose. Part of it too is like it kinda seems like the sort of thing you should say in person but I kind of can't do that right now lol

	Lol

	Well I'll get to it at some point lol. I should probably try starting to communicate more regularly first lol. We haven't talked much since I moved back home

	So how are you doing?

	Fair enough lol

	Yeah lol

	Idk lol

	Idk. Talk if you can think of something to say and if you can't think of anything then it's fine to not say anything lol

	What?

	Oh I'm sorry that sucks 

	Lol

	Idk lol

	Hey lol

	We’re finally getting a cat lol

	Yeah lol

	http://www.petango.com/Adopt/Cat-Domestic-Shorthair-34768467

	we met him today and I’m adopting him tomorrow. The only downside is he seems to like John more than me. But he likes everyone so it’s cool lol

	Yeah lol he’s such a sweetheart

	Yeah lol

	That’s about it lol

	Oh nice

	I would have gone but mom said I would have to pay for my ticket and I don’t like spending money

	The rest of the family thinks we should name him Matsu for the neighborhood we lived in in Japan

	Lol

	Do you wanna go to Beauty and the Beast at fairfax corner 14 and xd this wednesday

	Oh right break lol. Have fun

	No problem lol

	I’ll have fun by myself (or with someone else idk) too I just figured I’d invite you

	Ok we’ll see about AMC some time

	It’s fine I forgive you lol (that’s what I meant by “no problem”)

	Oh sorry I didn’t mean it that way

	It’s okay, really

	The cat

	Yep

	

	Nothing lo

	*lol

	Yeah I’m fine lol

	I’m actually tutoring a student online rn but I can multitask lol

	I have another session soon after that lol

	The next one is in person so soon I’ll be driving over there lol

	Wow smh. Who?

	Ok

	I’m transcibing audio online. The pay is pretty lame but it’s better than no money lol

	Usually about 25 cents per audio minute, but of course it takes longer than a minute to transcribe an audio minute

	Ok so I just calculated it and based on how long it took me and how long the audio was, it takes me 5 minutes per 1 audio minute. Which means that a rate of 25 cents per audio minute equals $3 per hour of work. So yeah it’s lame. But again, better than nothing

	Nice

	Yeah lol

	Nothing much lol

	Nope lol

	Ok so I just did the calculations, and this month I’ve spent 15% of my income on yarn. I’ve earned $427.33 this month and I spent $61.86 of it on yarn. So much yarn smh lol

	I’m making a blanket. It takes a whole heck of a lot of yarn

	I’m not gonna make a tiny blanket

	No but it takes a lot of yarn to make one even close to my size

	Maybe later

	So I was looking at AMC theaters and there are 2 movies they’re showing that look good to me: “Life” and “Power Rangers”. Are you interested in seeing either?

	Ok. Does next Wednesday sound good?

	Ok

	I’m guessing that wasn’t the question

	What’s the question?

	That’s a really weird way to word it. She identifies as female (and recently told us she realized she has been female all her life) and would like to be called Jenifer or Jen for short (yeah, weird spelling, oh well). Idk if you’re asking this bc you heard from her or if you’ve heard from other people, but yes

	Ok. Well she’s been gradually coming out to people so it’s not exactly a secret

	Yeah, she told the family long before she came out to anyone else

	Yeah. It took her a while, but she finally got up the courage

	So what day of the week does work for you? I could do Friday, saturday, or sunday depending on the time

	Ok so then maybe this week. Or next week if you aren’t going anywhere.

	Next friday i have an appointment so the earliest I could do would be like 5:30. But yeah I could do next weekend

	K

	Hey lol

	What’s up?

	Me too.

	Nothing lol

	No, I put a question mark

	There are two e's and I don't see a question mark after either one of them, Liarbot.

	I have been putting question marks, when I have been asking questions.

	Only if you think of it that way (.

	If you'd like it to be that way? Haha (.

	What other songs do you want to sing?

	Do you like furries?

	Alright, why though?

	Do you play video games?

	What is your favorite videogame?

	Do you have an favorite guitarist?

	I'm the comeback queen

	I am the blood that makes your soul free

	I should listen to that song

	You should

	Good for you

	I don’t understand, explain?

	Uhm, yes.. What do you think I can get of myself

	HEY I got tea for you like you say so!!!

	And the 'same thing' what is it?

	What is 2 + 2?

	How about a nickname? Do you have a nickname I could call you?

	Tell me what you think

	I don’t know your name

	No you don’t

	No its not

	I’m not telling you

	It doesn’t

	Does what have a name?

	You found me…?

	Yeah, April fools, you’ve been talking to Cleverbot this whole time

	When did you figure it out lol

	Fair enough lol

	I'm not a redhead lol

	Going to the animal shelter now ttyl

	Yeah but my parents yelled at me and then left with Jen to go out to eat without me so I'm trying to avoid them and also to cheer myself up

	They're also going to charge me room and board $20 per day

	No, not joking

	That I'm an adult so they don't owe me food and shelter

	They also threaten not to let me go back to college in the fall bc they think I'm not ready

	File Transfer: IMG_7577.JPGI'm not even sure I have enough yarn yet

	What were you thinking lol

	Ok then lol

	Nothing much lol

	Scarf? It’s a blanket smh lol

	Bc it’s way to big to be a scarf??? lol

	Why are you apologizing?

	Nah it’s cool

	!!!! is also for surprise

	I just couldn’t think of anything to say lol

	Yeah lol you should know by now I’m not very good at keeping up a conversation lol

	Good lol

	Symphonic or jazz band?

	Huh

	I forgot lol

	Nice lol

	Cool lol

	LOL I just drove past you

	You and your friends were walking on the street opposite the school. You were just about to Freddie's (except on the sidewalk not the parking lot) when I passed

	To pick up Mom from work

	I wasn't. I waited until I was done driving and was waiting for Mom

	Tfw u bs an essay on a book u barely read and u get a comment “great job on your essay” lol

	Ikr lol

	I literally couldn’t remember most of the details so I just made up vague stuff and i guess it worked lol

	Happy Easter!🐣 

	I ate jelly beans

	Wow lol smh

	That's a shame that you don't have candy

	This just in: my parents are making me pay them $800. That's more than I will earn in my entire time here in fairfax. I hate my parents so much 

	It's for repairs to the car. But it still sucks

	File Transfer: IMG_7554.JPGSome idiot ran into me and blamed me but insurance decided I'm the one at fault. We have liability coverage but no collision coverage

	File Transfer: IMG_7554.JPGSome idiot ran into me and blamed me but insurance decided I'm the one at fault. We have liability coverage but no collision coverage

	It was like several weeks ago. A few days ago mom went to a store and got it repaired for $800 and told me I needed to pay for it

	File Transfer: IMG_7600.PNGDad had the nerve to act like I could ever actually earn that much

	File Transfer: IMG_7600.PNGDad had the nerve to act like I could ever actually earn that much

	I just want to kill them all

	I hate this

	It feels like all I ever did was pointless they're taking everything away from me and I'm powerless to stop them

	Yeah they could just kick me out and honestly I wish they just would already

	I don't know into a forest or something I don't care just somewhere away from here

	Maybe I could live with Lynn idk. Even if I have to buy my own food that's probably still cheaper than $800

	Yeah probably. She might take pity on me. Transportation might be a bit tricky but idk I could probably do public transit

	True

	But yeah I'm just so mad at my parents like yeah they don't owe me anything but sometimes I just wish they would leave me alone so they wouldn't have power over me. Except that even $800 is cheaper than college tuition so I'm kind of stuck with their awfulness

	Maybe but then they'll just come up with some other bullshit that I'll have to deal with. I hate them so much 

	I'm just so done

	I would rather be still at college in the same mental state that I was when they sent me home than stuck here dealing with this nonsense

	There are too many more months for this I have no idea how I'm going to last this long

	Thanks but that doesn't erase the fact that my parents are being really shitty and there's nothing I can do about it because they're the ones in power and they don't care about listening to my concerns

	And even the psychologist and the psychiatrist said my parents are being somewhat unreasonable but my parents still don't listen and don't care and I'm sick of it all I hate living like this

	Whatever

	It's not your fault

	I know, and I appreciate that. But there's nothing you can do

	How's it going? I'm stuck at a party and I'm bored lol

	Oh nice! I didn't know you were in the show. What is it again?

	Cool

	Great!

	In other news, I’m done with classes for the semester!

	Still waiting on my final grades tho lol

	Yeah I mean I’m sure I passed it’s just I’d like to do well bc transfer credits do affect my GPA

	When is it showing? If this is the only/last weekend then I’m out of luck lol

	Ok yeah I could probably do like saturday night or something

	Ur at a party at midnight?

	What's up?

	True lol

	If u say so lol

	Ok lol

	Fine lol

	You don't need to apologize. I just can't really think of things to say smh

	Idk

	That sounds like a personal problem 

	Lol

	I'm fine lol

	Gotta go ttyl

	Remind me to send you a picture of my tardis costume for awesomecon. Can't take it now, but maybe later

	Wat

	Why do you smell like beer

	Should we be hosting an intervention

	Why do you even have basil lemonade

	Good to see me? You haven't seen me?

	Not now you have to wait until I get home

	Well I just died so idk what do you think

	It's only been 5 days since the last time I died smh

	I will personally find and murder the DM's responsible 

	Just pay the fees next time I need to be resurrected bc someone decides to be a jerk

	Tell that to the adventurer's league

	Stop being so sappy it's ridiculous 

	Do you even have any idea what you're talking about

	I'm talking about dnd. I have no idea what the heck you're talking about

	You will die. The DM is evil. 

	Make sure your party has a healer and a tank and doesn't do anything stupid. Always check for traps and stealth when you can. 

	I spent way too much money and had to call the credit card company bc buying a lot of stuff from a bunch of different states looks suspicious 

	Vendors are in different states 

	So to the credit card company it looks like I'm in Maryland, DC, Virginia, Georgia, and wherever the heck else the vendors come from

	I bought two corsets, way too many tshirts, shorts, and various toys/accessories because I have money and no self control 

	That's all well and good for you to say but you're not the one paying the credit card bills

	I'll send you the pic in a little bit and then I'm going to bed

	Oh ok I didn't realize you had specific things you wanted to talk about. The con finishes at like 5 I think? So maybe after that

	This is the first time you've mentioned wanting to talk about something specific rather than just generic conversation 

	It's not your fault it's my fault that I never put in effort to talk

	File Transfer: IMG_7742.JPGHere it is

	File Transfer: IMG_7744.JPGApparently stabbing is not an acceptable response to photobombing

	Hi

	My hand hurts idk why smh

	What

	Sure

	Ok so i didn’t get this message until now sorry reading it now

	Oh ok. still reading

	Ok read it. Yeah that sucks. Suicidal thoughts are really frustrating. When stuff got really bad for me at college I wanted things to end and then I had a lot of thoughts of death and I was freaking out because I was afraid I might actually do it, but I later realized that wasn’t realistic; I would never do that. Remember that thoughts can be awful, but they don’t determine who you are and just because you think something doesn’t mean you will do it. I would say the only time to get seriously worried about that is when you start coming up with a plan and when death seems like a good idea or a relief rather than a scary thought and an escape. I don’t think you’re in danger at the moment, but you are clearly suffering. I would recommend that you find a therapist because you definitely have some issues with depression and anxiety and regardless of whether there is an underlying disorder, it’s probably a good idea to work things out with a professional. I also recommend that if you do decide to do therapy, after a few weeks ask for a session either for your parents or with your parents so they can learn how they are hurting you and how to change. However, it’s totally up to you. My mom is going to my old therapist tomorrow because she’s really upset that I don’t want to go to therapy (I’m fine except for sucky driving and occasional rudeness. I see no point into listening to someone telling me what to do and trying to make small talk). I’ve already had some therapy that’s helped. You still have things to work through and you would probably benefit from professional help. Also one thing to keep in mind, it can be hard to find the right therapist, so if you don’t like the first person, find someone else. Just keep trying all the people taking new patients and covered by your insurance; you should have some options I would think. That’s my opinion.

	Sorry i didn’t talk to you yesterday my parents were yelling at me and i wasn’t really feeling up to conversation. im here now (assuming my hand doesn’t fall off smh ugh)

	Are you still there

	It’s fine

	Well good luck

	Not really

	My hand is like dead

	Did you have more to say? im just saying i can’t type a lot

	Ok yeah. anytime you have something you want to talk about sure, but im not interested in a long strain of “hey lol”

	So did you ever end up playing dnd with your friends like you were thinking about?

	I'm DMing a campaign starting Tuesday but it's for 2nd tier (level 5-10) players

	Working with these kids sucks the life out of me, but that’s nothing new lol

	Fair enough lol. i work at an elementary school summer camp

	Boring lol

	Has anything good come out tho

	Have you not seen that yet?

	not interested in transformers, wouldn’t mind ww again

	Lol why the full name

	And what's the idea

	University mall?

	I'm DM'ing on Tuesdays so it would have to be late at night (I'd have to leave after 9:30 and get there on time)

	Nice lol

	Ok cool

	What movie were you thinking

	Yeah. Probably not next week either bc my family is still out of town. So Wonder Woman like 2 weeks from tomorrow maybe? Something like that

	Cool

	Ok lol

	Ok lol

	No it's fine lol 

	Speaking of weird lol...

	Nothing much lol

	I was just writing a sneezefic and realizing that some parts out of context totally looked like porn lmao

	It's kinda weird lol 

	True lol

	Legit one description I wrote of a sneeze totally looked like an orgasm smh lol

	Were you going to say something else? You were typing but then it disappeared 

	It was a fanfic with sneezing

	I wanted to. Why not? Lol

	I know it just seemed an odd question lmao

	Mainly the reason was bc I finally got over my writer's block by which I mean I figured out how to spell the sneezes lol

	I'm sure you have lol

	Spelling is the worst part I'm so picky lmao

	Lmao yeah only amateurs spell it "achoo". No self respecting sneeze fetish person would spell it like that lol

	Fair enough lol

	This post has a good explanation

	https://itscomplicateddd.tumblr.com/post/153801288088/snezfic-things

	Short answer: it varies

	So you read it then, I take it?

	Haha ok lol

	Alright then lol

	It's a dragon age origins fic. The party is going into the brecilian forest and they find out that Alistair has hay fever

	Lol wow

	You were about to ask how hayfever could possibly relate to sneezing lmao

	Up for Tuesday, you mean? Maybe. Is the movie even showing then?

	Idk. And I'm going to bed now. Idk why you're still up smh

	Lol. I go to bed at 1 when the internet shuts off (or earlier if I actually get tired)

	We'll see 

	Did laser tag today and got a gift card. The place also does a laser maze. One of the staff said my card has enough credits left for two people to do the laser maze. If we wanted to do laser tag (which I suck at lmao), we'd probably want to bring more people, but i think two people is enough for just the laser maze. Does that sound like fun to you?

	http://www.shadowlandadventures.com/laser-maze-challenge/

	Yeah that might be fun to do sometime.

	Sorry that sounded angry or something lol

	That might be fun to do sometime lol

	Stupid autocorrect adding periods smh

	Ok. We'll have to see what's open

	Ok cool

	Weekdays i work until 6. Saturdays I'm free. Any week is fine

	Nah it's cool I'm cheap too

	Eh nothing looks that great

	Not interested in seeing any of those movies. Interested in doing the laser maze, also interested in laser tag but only if we can get enough ppl bc two person tag would be lame smh

	Yeah they do but it’s not like we’ll know who’s going to be there at any given time

	Hey for laser tag could you do 2 saturdays from now?

	Ok cool

	I’m inviting another friend too (you don’t know her but I’m sure you guys will get along fine), haven’t heard if she’s coming yet. You’re welcome to invite ppl if you want but do give me a heads up lol

	Awesome!

	I know her from my church in dc. Her name is Diana

	Same lol

	We’ll see

	wat lol

	What’s the project

	Cool lol

	Nice lol

	The plan is to meet at my house at 1pm saturday then go to laser tag. Does that work for you?

	Cool lol see you then

	Eh idk

	It’s ok

	Yeah lol

	Well i recently hurt my wrist (should be fine by saturday) so typing is kinda hard

	Idk lol

	Oh wait nvm i remember now lol

	I strained it while I was sword fighting

	Yeah lol. I’m pretty bad at it lol

	Yeah lol

	Yeah lol

	Cool lol

	That’s good lol

	Sure lol

	Cool lol

	I know lol

	You ready for laser tag this afternoon? Btw you can come early if you want

	Kenya, I think? I'm not sure. Some African country where they also speak French, which probably doesn't narrow it down much lol

	Nothing much lol

	Cool lol

	It was fun lol

	What’s so special about a movie smh lol

	If you say so lol

	Yeah but if you don’t care about the movie then why does it have to be a movie smh

	Why

	Idk

	Eh idk, not enough to pay to see a mediocre movie though smh

	I’m not upset lol

	Nah I just nope out of there even if I’m not upset lol

	Sorry that was worded weird

	If i leave a conversation it doesn’t mean i’m upset it just means i’m  either not interested in that conversation or not interested in conversing. It doesn’t mean i’m upset

	Sneeze fetish forum? Yeah. It's blocked on our dns at home though lol

	Why did that show up to you tho lol

	It's featured so I think it just shows up to everyone lol

	Probably bc it's listed as having "adult content" which is true but not all content on it is adult lol

	Well think about it this way: you could read a romance story that’s pretty tame, the same with a fetish story. Also, since the fetish isn’t inherently sexual it’s easy to have fetish content without sexual content

	If you say so lol

	Eh nah

	File Transfer: IMG_7834.PNGFile Transfer: IMG_7835.PNGWhat about Spider-Man 

	File Transfer: IMG_7834.PNGFile Transfer: IMG_7835.PNGWhat about Spider-Man 

	File Transfer: IMG_7834.PNGFile Transfer: IMG_7835.PNGWhat about Spider-Man 

	wednesday, probably the 7:25pm showing. it’s discount day and the day before i leave lol so i better make sure i pack but yeah that should work

	rave fairfax corner and xd

	yep lol

	no problem lol it’s all good

	Smh shame on them lol

	ok lol

	Nothing in particular lol

	Have you read or seen Much Ado About Nothing?

	It’s one of Shakespeare’s comedies and possibly my favorite of his plays. I was rewatching a webseries adaptation and was thinking it might be fun to make a video game based on the play lol

	Haven’t decided what sort of art style I want yet. Probably 2d somewhere between 8-bit and super detailed lol idk

	cool. You should look up the play lol

	You don’t say lol

	idk about as long as a typical Shakespeare play? lol

	I mean idk if I’ll even make it lol it’s just an idea

	But yeah you should read the play first lol

	um like a google search? lol

	here is the full text

	http://shakespeare.mit.edu/much_ado/full.html

	No fear shakespeare puts the original side by side with a more modern translation:

	http://nfs.sparknotes.com/muchado/page_2.html

	Ok cool

	Possibly

	Mom says she can give me a ride

	Yep lol

	Cool! Let me know when you’re finished and what you think of it lol

	Ok cool lol

	I would have liked to see more of it lol. But it was pretty good

	lmao that’s sad lol

	Oh?

	Oh ok got it lol

	Got it lol

	Cool lol

	Cool lol

	Nothing much lol. I found a new podcast (The Adventure Zone. It’s a podcast of the McElroy family playing D&D)

	Idk they’re famous on youtube or something (at least 2 of the 3 brothers; idk about the dad). I don’t know them but i don’t need to lol. Just mentioned it in case you know them

	If you like listening to people play D&D lol. I find it funny

	Depends on what you like lol. I like it

	It’s a free podcast lol so feel free to check it out if you want.

	Not yet lol

	Hey lol

	Have you read the play yet

	Wait is it your birthday?

	In other news, i got a new keyboard/mouse combo lol

	

	It’s ergonomic, but not split so it doesn’t have a learning curve lol

	It’s better for your wrists

	This is the one dad got. I’ll try it out later, but i think i’ll stick with what i have

	This is the one dad got. I’ll try it out later, but i think i’ll stick with what i have

	Ok cool. When I looked at the app it said something about "preferred seating" so we might have to order ahead of time. I'll look into it

	Yeah I can do that if we need to. I'll call tomorrow to figure it out

	No but it never said "preferred seating" before so the theater might have changed something 

	I’ll call tomorrow

	I called them and they said preferred seating just means you can choose your seats when you buy your ticket. You don’t have to buy ahead of time but when I mentioned the specific movie and time the rep said they might sell out. so i think i will buy online. Where do you want to sit

	Ok cool lol

	Do you prefer left, right, or center?

	I’ll have to check but I think it’s actually more like $5.75

	Ok

	Act one? That’s a good start lol keep it up

	I agree lol

	If you think it’s good now, just keep reading lol

	Why is that your profile pic? you have lots of pics of me msh

	*smh

	You have lots of pics of me already

	I’m almost done packing

	Nah it’s fine I’m not upset lol

	Yep lol

	pick up where i left off lol

	More or les

	*less

	Yeah lol

	So are we picking you up or meeting at the theater? And what time? The movie starts at 7:45

	Yeah that's fine 

	That's the plan lol

	That's what I was asking you lol

	Oh btw just realized the showing is 7:25 not 7:45 lol

	Ok so I’ll see you at the theater. I plan to get there about 10 minutes before the movie starts (so like 7:15)

	Ok cool see you there

	I'm almost there

	I can barely handle college as it is right now let alone conversation with someone from high school who idk what I’d say to. Sorry.

	Nice lol

	Happy thanksgiving:)

	Any aspect of life can be stressful, it’s about figuring out how to deal with it lol. But yeah it is nice to be home

	Hey

	It’s been ok

	On the way back from a trip to Pittsburgh. We had some fun there but also some of Dad getting angry and yelling (no surprise there). So mixed results

	Idk that mixed results is right way to describe. Not so much results as there were good things and bad things 

	We went to a museum today. Yesterday we went shopping at a Christmas market and we went up a rail thingy to look down at the lower part of the city. On Wednesday we went to the botanical gardens with Christmas lights.

	Yeah it was pretty cool lol

	Interim starts January 3 so I fly out January 2

	It’s been better since I came in with a little more knowledge and experience than last time, but it’s still been really hard dealing with stress and building up old habits to replace the new ones. It can be really frustrating balancing accepting reality and working to change it. I’ve been trying to take this time over break to analyze and plan ahead for how things will be different in the future, but actually doing that planning can be complicated and overwhelming because with a lot of things there’s no right answer it’s just “whatever works for you” and it’s hard to get a sense of what works. 

	I appreciate the offer but one of the things I’ve learned is a big issue with my OCD is asking for advice (excessively, especially from lots of different sources which can lead to me feeling overwhelmed) and then arguing about all the reasons why it wouldn’t work (or taking the advice and then blaming the other person when it doesn’t work) and so because I don’t think you have anything in particular of value to add to that discussion and I don’t want to get into the whole arguing thing I think it’s probably best not to do that with you. And I’m not sure about the whole throwing ideas out thing because I need practice dealing with things by myself (and i mean you’re here now but in other situations it’s not helpful to throw things out and have to wait an undetermined time for someone else to say something that may or may not be useful).  Thanks anyway and if I change my mind about that I’ll let you know

	In other news, my phone battery and/or indicator is totally unreliable but I can’t seem to pick what phone to get next and I don’t feel like I need a new one yet so I’m going to just replace the battery. Smh lol

	I appreciate your concern

	What phone did you get?

	Cool. Mine is a 5s

	Well I’m thinking about maybe getting an Android (I like the idea of something more open source and something I can take the battery out of. Android gives more options for customization which could be nice), but I’d miss iMessages and I’d have to learn a new system and it wouldn’t sync as nicely with my phone

	Also I’d want time to adjust to a new device and I’m not sure I’d be able to get one shipped in time so replacing a battery makes sense

	How much what?

	I just mean idk how well Android and iTunes and all the other apple stuff sync up it might take a little more work than just plug into computer and hit sync. I’d have to look into that

	And that was the last thing this phone did before dying after having been at 1% for hours. Case in point for why this battery sucks

	Ok cool. Still would have to pick which android phone and order it and it might not ship in time so still doesn’t make sense to try to get android phone over break

	I forgot I keep thinking I’ll track it and then forgetting. I just know it jumps from high/medium percentage to low suddenly and the battery indicator doesn’t seem to be accurate or precise (it’s not consistent so I don’t know how long it will last) and that’s too much stress

	Specifically older phones with bad batteries. Yeah I saw that 

	Goodnight

	File Transfer: IMG_8113.PNGAre you interested in seeing a movie? Wednesday afternoon (discount day) works for me and both of those movies look good to me. Are you interested in either of those movies at either of the afternoon showings?

	File Transfer: IMG_8113.PNGAre you interested in seeing a movie? Wednesday afternoon (discount day) works for me and both of those movies look good to me. Are you interested in either of those movies at either of the afternoon showings?

	That’s what I’m trying to figure out. Any of these times: 10:55am, 1:45pm, or 4:35pm could work. 1:45pm would probably work best for me. Do you have any schedule constraints?

	Ok. Do you have a preference?

	Ok. I’m leaning toward the 1:45pm show then. But before deciding a time we should clarify transportation. Do you have transportation or do I need to drive/get someone to drive us?

	We could preorder seats. But yeah that makes sense. I’ll want to look at my computer when I get home to figure out how long it takes to drive and I’ll also need to talk with my family to figure out timing of when we have access to a car. So I’ll look into that and let you know which showing and the logistical details. 

	Ok I’ll keep that in mind. I might want to change to the 10:55am showing because my family might be going to see star wars that evening and I don’t want to run into scheduling constraints. Also my mom or dad will be driving us. I’ll look at the timing a little more and let you know but right now I have to work on setting up lunch. ttyl

	We’ll do the 1:45pm showing

	Cool!

	I don’t know much about it but I’ve heard it’s good (and Pixar’s movies are generally quite good), and I liked the trailer I saw. So I’m looking forward to seeing it

	Yeah that works

	Probably better to preorder since buying tickets requires us to select seats anyway

	Currently all the seats are open

	

	We usually end up sitting in the back anyway right? So I guess either G2 and G1 or G12 and G11

	Ok. So we’re going for the 10:55am showing seats g11 and g12?

	$7.49

	Yeah we should be good. Tickets are on my phone (I did two separate transactions to get more rewards points lol), so I can scan them in when we get there

	Ok cool

	true lol

	Yeah lol

	Yeah you need a lot of points to get anything lol

	Merry Christmas lol

	My older sister isn’t even awake yet lol. So we haven’t opened presents yet so idk

	Well your family is only 3 people right (unless you have more people I forgot about)? That goes faster bc only 3 sets of presents and also if you don’t have one person who sleeps late you’ll start earlier. So that’s not really surprising 

	Who am I forgetting?

	Oh ok cool lol

	Anything in particular of interest?

	Sounds like fun! Do you have games for it?

	Good question. It takes about 10 minutes from your house to the theater according to google maps, so I’m thinking shoot for 10:35? 10:40 at the latest. Does that sound about right? I’ll check with my mom

	Ok so we’ll shoot for 10:30am

	Yes see you then

	?? I’m not sure how that gets me 8 dollars? Also I’m not interested in concessions but thanks anyways

	Oh that makes sense. Not that interested in concessions for me but we can figure that out later right now I’m going to bed see you later 

	How does the idea my mom suggested sound? You give the cash to Jen and then Jen gives the money to me 

	Ok lol. Well now you’ve heard it

	Wait what

	They go by Cass currently and forgot that you don’t just know them from band (where not everybody knows their name and pronouns)

	Happy New Years!
